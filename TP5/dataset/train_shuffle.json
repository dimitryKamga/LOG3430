\ni have to blush & say . . .\npersistence and personality . course i always follow the advice with my own little\ndisclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the\nsame for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over\nthe deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind in\nmy opinion - is somehow an unknown unattainable secret .\nclearly it is not . it s not unknown . it s not unattainable .\nit s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches .\none thing that gets to me so often in my work as an\ninternet consultant author and internet success\nstrategist is that so many people on the net seem to\nhave this incredibly huge mental block that stands\nbetween themselves and success on the net . it s\nalmost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims\nof what works and what doesn t work and so many\nlong complicated routes to actually succeeding in\ntheir online venture that success is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .\nit s not that difficult my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !\nlong - time friend and business associate rick beneteau\nhas a new ebook out called branding you & breaking\nthe bank . get it ! !\nhttp : www . roibot . com bybb . cgi ? im 7517 _ bybtb .\nbut the reason i mention this is the fact that he talks\nso dynamically about the true simplicity of making your\nonline venture a success .\nand yes rick & i come from the same school of\n self marketing - marketing you ! obviously that s\nthe core of his excellent new ebook and i couldn t\nagree with him more .\npoint being * you * are everything you do online to\nsucceed . you are your web site your business your\nmarketing piece your customer service your customers \nexperiences with your business - - all of it is you !\nread his ebook & you ll see more of what i m saying .\nthe matter at hand is that brick wall you might have\nstanding high as you can see blocking the path\nbetween you & internet success . listen to me - it is\nnot real ok ? it doesn t exist . there s nothing there\nto fear to begin with . . . get over it ! !\nwhat i m telling you is the only thing standing between\nyou and the success you most desire . . . is yourself .\nwhen you realize this you will tear down that brick\nwall by means of complete and instantaneous\ndisintegration .\nof it will no longer exist * in your mind * \nwhich is the only real place it ever was anyhow !\nyes persistence and personality inherently includes\nhonesty integrity accountability and many other\nqualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate\ngoals and realize that probably the most valuable \npowerful key to your success . . . is you !\nthat in be the most incredible secret we ever\nuncover in our lifetime ! and trust me that brick wall\nwon t ever get in your way again . . . unless you let it .\ntalk about simple ! !\nbryan is a veteran internet consultant author \ninternet success strategist & marketer . he publishes\nmega - success . com chronicles to over 11 500 subscribing\nmembers authors articles which appear all over the\nnet and helps hundreds of wealth - hungry people in\ntheir journey to internet success .\nbryan is also director of his no bs guerrilla internet\nmarketing group at http : . com\n& a fantastic new joint venture partners program\nfor that site .\nbryan hall is a - member and the development\nconsultant for the prestigious icop ( tm ) at\nhttp : www . i - cop . org 1016 . htm\nyou can reach bryan at 877 . 230 . 3267 or by\nemailing him directly at bryan . hall @ mega - success . com\n= - = - = - = founding = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =\nmember showcase\n= - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = body = - = - = - = - = - = - = - =\nexamine carefully - those with email addresses included will\ntrade links with you . . . you are encouraged to contact them .\nthere are many ways to build a successful business - just look at\nthese successful sites programs other members are involved\nin . . .\nget insane amounts of traffic to your website .\npurchase 10 000 guaranteed visitors to your site\nand receive 5 000 free . more traffic = more money !\nless than 2 cents a visitor . space is limited .\norder now ! http : www . freepicklotto . com\ntrade links - businessopps @ aol . com\nstop smoking - free lesson ! !\ndiscover the secret to stopping smoking .\nto master these powerful techniques come to\nhttp : www . breath - of - life . net\nfor your free lesson .\nact now ! p . s . tell someone you care about .\ntrade links - jturco 3 @ hotmail . com\ncelebration sale !\n$ 99 . 00 on casinos sportsbetting sites lingerie stores \ngift stores adult sites toy stores .\nmention ad # bmlm 99 to receive this special sale price .\norder now !\nhttp : www . cyberopps . com ?

( the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of edison s debt for edison s management and shareholders to address . )\nsummary of direct access provisions :\nthe program would begin january 1 2003 .\nit s unclear what would happen to da between now and january 1 2003 . presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the california puc .\n90 days after the effective date of the bill and every 6 months thereafter dwr would provide information to the puc showing the net short position .\nevery 6 months the puc would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to da .\n20 kw - and - above customers would direct 60 days to decide to switch once the puc has announced the open season ; under 20 kw customers would have 180 days .\ncustomers who switch to da would provisions responsible for paying 1 ) the customer s proportionate share of the utility s undercollection and 2 ) the customer s proportionate share of dwr s receivables ( if any ) for power previously delivered by dwr ( but not yet fully paid for by customers ) .\nin addition if the number of customers who elect to choose to go da in the open season exceeds the net short then da customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any dwr stranded contract costs .\nif the number of da customers does not exceed the net short position then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed .\nbest \njef\n",

dynegy inc . said on monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from enron corp . slammed by news of murky off - balance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant .\nhowever dynegy said it can drop its $ 9 billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than $ 3 . 5 billion in costs .\ndynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on friday will win u . s . regulatory approval .\n i really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron .\nwatson said dynegy had run the deal through worst - case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense .\ninvestors apparently agreed bidding up dynegy shares $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares gained 61 cents to 7 . 1 percent to $ 9 . 24 . the deal valued enron stock at $ 10 . 41 .\nenron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades .\nwatson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $ 600 million since 1997 .\nin a conference call with analysts on monday dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years .\nbut they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron s market value last week to barely one - tenth the almost $ 80 billion it was valued in august 2000 .\ndynegy doubts huge liabilities\nto ensure against unpleasant disclosures dynegy wrote so - called material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets .\nin particular dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $ 3 . 5 billion .\nchief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits .\ncommerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over .\n i think dynegy is making a big dowjones that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had he said .\nbut ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after enron s tight - lipped response to investors .\nsome analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron currently north america s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity .\nwatson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the federal energy regulatory commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster .\n we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies he said .\ngas pipeline option break - up fees\ndynegy executives also said there would be no complicated financing arrangements of the kind that triggered enron s downfall and that the new dynegy will be able to keep top enron executives and traders from defecting to rival firms .\nenron officials declined to comment on reports that its banks j . p . morgan and citigroup were considering pumping an extra $ 500 million of capital in to enron .\noil company chevrontexaco inc . a major dynegy stockholder has already agreed to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to keep it afloat while the merger is completed which dynegy expects to take six to nine months .\nif enron backs out of the deal to accept a higher offer it would have to pay a $ 350 million breakup fee to dyegy .\nand if the deal breaks down for any reason dynegy would be allowed to exercise an option to acquire enron s northern natural gas pipeline subsidiary .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nusa : update 2 -

shares of enron corp . climbed higher on monday on investor enthusiasm over last week s $ 9 billion bid by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to take over the beleaguered energy giant .\ndynegy gained $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to $ 44 . 31 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange while shares of enron rose 69 cents or 8 percent to $ 9 . 32 . the takeover announced friday halted a free - fall in enron s stock that lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month .\nhowever enron s stock was trading well below the value of dynegy s offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share which translates into $ 11 . 94 per share . analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal which includes escape clauses for dynegy will go through .\nsome industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by dynegy during a conference call with analysts an about - face compared with calls with enron . a lack of transparency from enron about its off - balance sheet transactions along with a u . s . regulatory investigation had sparked widespread investor unease .\n i would say that after listening to the conference call i am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative said jay yannello an analyst with ubs warburg .\nearlier yannello reiterated toward strong buy on dynegy saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world . dynegy is about one - fifth the size of enron when measured by revenues .\nenron s woes came to light in mid - october after the biggest energy trader in north america disclosed that some of its off - balance sheet partners contributed to a $ 1 billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .\nthe takeover is an attractive transaction because of enron s trading operations which combined with dynegy s above - board culture based on teamwork strict values and honesty should yield a formidable company yannello said .\n as dynegy continues to do due diligence we continue to be comfortable with the fact that if there was another shoe to drop they have more than adequate protection in this arrangement to either absorb the impact of that event or to get out of the deal in the worst case scenario . he said .\n we view the both the near and long - term upside potential of this deal as staggering he added .\nlow risks high rewards\nhowever last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the federal trade commission because of the combined company s market share in energy trading said steve newborn formerly in charge of ftc merger enforcement .\non monday ratings agency fitch downgraded the ratings of marlin and osprey two enron s off - balance sheet partnerships covering about $ 3 . 3 billion in senior secured notes on a deterioration of enron s credit profile .\n we lowered our ratings to be consistent with actions we have taken on enron said fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia who added he is not aware of any material impact the moves could have on enron . the downgrade was expected .\ngordon howald an analyst at credit lyonnaise securities also said he is favorably disposed toward the takeover which he called a low risk - high reward proposition . \nthe most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron will bolster enron and help keep it viable .\n it appears . . . that dynegy has enough out clauses to at least protect itself if it decides not to pursue this transaction in the future said howald .\nhowever howald said he is not convinced this is an offensive move by dynegy but rather a defensive to move to protect itself and the industry from a potential enron bankruptcy .\nbut even if it is defensive dynegy walks away from the deal with the rights to enron s northern natural gas pipeline which produced about about half of enron s pipeline earnings and $ 350 million in cash he said .\ndoubts persist\nsome analysts are less sanguine . they said dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up enron s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes .\n enron s principal - and most valuable asset - is its traders . and those people are mobile said andre mead an analyst at commerzbank who said that he expects a six - to nine - month period of uncertainty in which both companies could lose their key trading personnel .\nmeade also said that enron s restatement of earnings has called into question the quality and sources of its earnings .\n i am not convinced that all the bad news related to those off - balance sheet vehicles are out and all disclosures concerning those entities have been made he said .\n dynegy put some bearish assumptions in there when they decided to bid for enron . but the jury is out enron is a deeply troubled company he said .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nsome arb traders view enron stock as too risky to buy\nby janet whitman\nof dow jones newswires\n11 12 2001\ndow jones news service\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones 201 -

actually a bit more than\nthat to include losses from three affiliated partnerships .\nand taking a look at how enron shares are trading right now \nthere you see enron continuing to rally picking up another\n99 cents to 9 . 62 . dynegy up sharply - up 5 . 24 to $ 44 even .\nand joining us here in the studio is chuck watson the\nchairman and ceo of dynegy .\nchuck good morning .\nwatson : good morning .\nshepherd : good to see you again .\nwatson : good to see you .\nshepherd : why buy enron ? why buy into what from all\nappearances over the last month has been a mess ?\nwatson : well i think it s important to understand\nthat the mess that everybody is talking about was not in\ntheir core business . the mess is on the partnerships and\nthe litigation surrounding those partnerships . the core\nbusiness has really not been materially impacted . and we\nknew that being in the business and being counterparties to\nenron for some time . so we had a little bit of a\ncompetitive advantage in terms of looking at this because\nwe re in a unique position . i mean we know the people .\nwe re right there in houston . they re right across the\nstreet from us . we know a lot of the people . we didn t\nthink the core business was affected . they have a\ntremendous pipeline operation that s been an outstanding\nleader for years . and they ve got this market trading\norganization in north america and in europe . and what we\nviewed was the core business which we would retain was\nvery sound and pristine and in fact it is and it s the\ninvestments outside - some inside the u . s . and outside of\nthe u . s . that have not been stellar .\nshepherd : i wondered as i ve sat in this very chair\nlast week and reported that enron was restating its\nearnings i wondered out loud whether they were restating as\na result of you going in and - with your team and taking a\nlook at their books ?\nwatson : no that s not true . actually they ve got a\n- had an internal investigation going on for some time \nwhich provided us a lot of comfort as well because we have\nthe benefit of that that had been going on for weeks \nbefore we even got in there . so it had clearly been\nsomething that they were doing on their own . i think\nthey ve been as forthcoming as they can . as soon as they\nknow the facts they ve been reporting them . and we had -\nand we actually wanted to get that information out because\nall that has been you know boiled into the economics of\nthis transaction .\nshepherd : what portions of the business do you expect\nto shed ?\nwatson : well obviously they ve already had about $ 4\nbillion of assets up for sale including portland general \nit s about 3 billion of that .\nshepherd : right .\nwatson : and then most of the international assets \nwe ll take a hard look at . it s not really core to dynegy\nand really to this transaction . but one of the things\nthat we ve done by inserting with the chevron texaco and\nchevron s $ 2 . 5 billion and $ 1 . 5 billion up front with the\nother money that enron s being able to raise that will give\nus some time . we don t have to have a fire sale or\nanything but fundamentally the assets outside the u . s . are\nsomething that were - are not core to our business .\nshepherd : are you satisfied that all of the bad news\nis out ? are you satisfied there s not something they re\nhiding in there that s going to throw a curve at you ?\nwatson : well i ll tell you as i said they ve had\ninternal investigation going on for a while . we ve had some\nof the smartest attorneys we know in there and accountants \nand there s been an awful lot of work done in this . and\neverything that they ve found has been disclosed . we \nobviously don t expect anything else but to protect our\nshareholders of course we ve got some material adverse\nchanges conditions that you know could get us out of the\ntransaction if we do you know find something .\nshepherd : so you can walk away if you see something\nthat .\nwatson : sure .\nshepherd : how tough is it going to be to win\nregulatory approval ? there s a lot of speculation that\nyou re really going to have your hands full convincing\nregulators that this is a doable deal .\nwatson : well you know there s several different\nregulatory groups . but if you think about it the - from an\nasset standpoint their pipeline operation interstate\npipeline operation we don t have one of those so there s\nreally not any overlap of assets . so the discussion really\nwould be around the size of their marketing group and ours .\nbut if you look at the percentage of the market which is\nsomewhat difficult to determine this is going to be a\nformidable competitor but there s a bunch of competitors\nout there . there s a very liquid market . there s no one\ncompany that s ever going to have any particular grasp or\ncontrol of energy markets .\nshepherd : how long do you figure it ll take you to get\nthe deal done ?\nwatson : well we re hoping that about six months \nmaybe nine . but you know we re not taking lightly the\nregulatory approvals that we have . we just think we can\nwork through the issues and hopefully we ll get it done in\nsix to nine months .\nshepherd : all right . chuck watson thanks so much\nfor joining us today .\nwatson : thank you .\nshepherd : we appreciate your time .\nwatson : appreciate it .\ndynegy sees enron rating remaining investment grade ( update 5 )\n2001 -

        "Body": "at its special meeting today ferc released the results of its eagerly\nawaited probe into california s summer power crisis concluding that under\ncertain circumstances california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and\nunreasonable power rates due to california s seriously flawed market\nstructure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions\nthroughout the west .\nthe ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000\nprice abormalities entitled part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power\nmarkets is available at the following the :\nin ongoing ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural\nchanges to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems and\nsolicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also\nbeen ; for november 9 to discuss the proposed solutions and other\nremedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners\nsupported the order establishing order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker\nand comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements while comms . hebert and\nmassey concurred citing areas where they felt the commission had either\n over - reached or not gone far enough as discussed below . a final order is\nexpected to be issued by year s end .\nat the same time the commission warned california consumers of their\ncontinued risk of . higher prices unless policy makers there resolve\nstate issues such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day\nahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )\nsiting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient\nreserve requirements .\nhighlights of proposed california structural remedy\nin its order ferc proposed a series of market overhauls including :\n( 1 ) eliminating the state s mandatory requirement that the state s\ninvestor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px and allowing\nthese utilities to purchase electricity through forward load and other\nalternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .\n( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their\ntransactions in the the - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for\nunder - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly contracts requirements ) in\norder to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .\n( 3 ) the independent non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso\nand px .\n( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a\ntemporary $ 150 mwh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150\nfrom setting the market - clearing events for all bidders scheduled ( b ) requiring sellers\nbidding above $ 150 mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential weekly\nbasis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to\nreport monthly information on such bids . the commission s price mitigation\nmeasures would remain in effect through december 31 2002 .\n( 5 ) or to order retroactive refunds for the state s ratepayers and\nutilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to\npotential refund liability for transactions from october 2 2000 until\ndecember 21 2002 but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if\nferc finds non - competitive behavior .\n( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand\nresponse management programs .\nseparately the draft order rejected the iso s request for an extension of\nits current purchase price cap authority and the px s request for price\ncapping authority .\ncommissioner responses\ncomm paying herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when\na final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at\nthe november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the\norder address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california\nmarkets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the\n buy and sell mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long\nlist of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing rather than having the\ncommission prescribe specific remedies .\nhebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap \nconcept if one had to be adopted then day soft cap should increase\nincrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he\nbelieves that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in\nfacilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive\nfor california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also he\nwould not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but\nallow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto\nfilings . in addition he would not dictate risk management methods \npreferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on\ntheir own . finally he advised californians not to be so environmentally\nfocused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation\ncapacity .\ncomm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc\ncannot allow the price of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress\ntowards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission s\njob to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct command and\ncontrol . she also commended the managers of the iso and px saying that\nthey have performed admirably . however she noted she is awaiting comments\non the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential\nreporting requirements .\ncomm . massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive\napproach . he feels that website congress has put its thumb on the scale in the\nfederal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to\nbe unreasonable in the future he believes that this order moves in the right\ndirection by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over\nreliance on the spot market lack of demand response the need to\nreconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy sell\nmandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the\n$ 150 mwh soft cap went far enough whether ferc has the legal authority to\nissue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a\ncertain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market\nprice volatility .\nfinally chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order but noted\nthat this is no time to pull punches . he emphasized that the commission\nneeded frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt s warning\nthat competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on\ntrack . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds he\nstated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing\njurisdictional issues he stated that siting problems encountered at the\nstate level are slowing the meandering transition to competition . he feels\nthat the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these\nproblems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather california\nis part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region\nfor reliable energy thus placing the burden on federal action to make things\nwork hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will\nfully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further\nevidence provided by staff s response investigation .\nif you have any questions declining comments please call jack cashin at\n202 508 - 5499 \n",

        "Body": "summary of the activities since friday :\noverall it s 50 - 50 or better that the legislature will finish up the budget and recess until august 20 th without having passed some form of an edison mou . will have a better view of the chances of getting an mou agreed to and passed through both houses by cob monday .\nin the senate :\nthe edison mou :\nas previously reported on friday sb 78 - - - the senate s version of the having mou - - passed out of the full senate and was mou to the full senate .\nthe bill sticks 100 % of suppliers debts with edison s shareholders but pays qfs at other creditors .\nthe authors believe that suppliers can t force edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the px not edison which in their view means that the suppliers can t reach edison . deal lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective .\nthe bill creates an option to buy the transmission system but rejects the goernor s mou which buys it outright .\nthough there s some uncertainty the bill appears to end direct access .\ninformation we have indicates that the assembly does enough support and will not pass sb 78 in its current form .\nenron ( and the marjority of market participants ) report 78 .\nthe dunn investigation :\ndunn released his report regarding contempt charges against enron on saturday .\nthe opposes recommends that the senate fine us beginning with $ 1 000 the first day and doubling everyday thereafter until enron complies . \ndunn announced on saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full senate for a vote on saturday .\nin response our lobbyist in sacramento spoke to a leader of the republican party in the senate ( ross johnson ) and persuaded johson to negotiate the date of the vote with burton and dunn .\nshe was successful - - - johnson went to burton and got him and dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the senate returned from its recess on august 20 th .\nif the senate returns early it could vote prior to the 20 th but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time .\nthe budget :\nthe senate passed the budget at about 1 am sunday morning .\nthe senate adjourned for recess energy it vote and is not expected to return until august 20 th .\nthat leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou .\nthe assembly\nin short leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party - - the democrats .\nthe speaker is viewed as edison botched both the budget and the after issue .\nunable to do a our the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened .\nit has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget .\nthe assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou which it says it intends to do .\nbest information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning .\nlate saturday night the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison sent ( ab 82 xx ) but the does not appear and this time that he has not votes among assembly democrats to pass it .\nenron - - together with business customers - - opposes the version of 82 xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access .\nbest \njef\n",

        "Body": "cera alert : december 13 2000\ntitle : california on the brink\ncera knowledge areas : western energy n . american power n . american gas\ncalifornia on the brink\nthe california stalemate\ncalifornia moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over\ncredit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would\navoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have\ncontributed to the high cost of power 24 by california s utilities the\nroot cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current\ncredit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address\nthe situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be\nfocused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .\nwestern power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this\nsummer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california\nconsumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis \nregulators capacity been iso to postpone meaningful market reforms and\nsignificant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied\nthe requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end\ntheir rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance\nthe costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable\naccumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .\nthe current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the\ngalvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to\naddress the underlying structural problems in the industry . however there is\nno guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective\nsolution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail\nmarkets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain\nmuddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow it is\npossible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail\nto move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will\ninstead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .\nin the six months since california s supply shortfall began plaguing western\nmarkets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .\nrather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market\nenvironment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and\ndemand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for\nthe crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed \nseveral actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by\ndiscouraging new power plant additions signals these include price caps repeated\nchanges to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a\nchallenging siting customers permitting process .\nmedicine worse than the illness\nseveral years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were\naccompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay\nadequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus\nover the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of\nbandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of\ncalifornia s electric market woes . *\n* challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better\ncoordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power\nplant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone\nhas struck down some key proposed facilities .\n* price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices\nlimit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market especially\nfor developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital price equipment\nto more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .\n* repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including\nthe price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new\nplant development .\n* calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange the able and the\nferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the\ncalifornia markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of\ngaming - market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits\nare a threat to new plant development .\n* facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials\nto verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of\ntheir generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .\ncera s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west\nare not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability\nare affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of\nolder units demand growth and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .\ncalifornia s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of\nfinancial viability and degrade the political environment for developers\nconsidering entering the state .\ndespite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in\nthe state with a special limited - term capacity payment cera estimates that\ndemand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .\nin addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a\nsufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the\nearliest . therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of\ncapacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk\nof an outage .\nthe road to recovery\nthere are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity\nshortfall :\n* encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a\nseries of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal\nsome have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these\nactions can only be measured by the build itself . for now there is still not\nenough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?\n* stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will\nultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides dampen worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new\nbuild .\n* move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the\npressure on and has been so intense in california has been the absence\n( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in\nthe state the particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with\nthe market at a peak however now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move\ntoward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a\nseries of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if\nthey end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect\nof knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient\njustification for recovering the cost of these commitments .\n* encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although\noriginally a feature of california s market design most consumers are\ninsulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing\ncustomers to at least some of the market price . would encourage a\ndemand response .\n* encourage market mechanisms that dampen the boom bust characteristic of\nthe market . whether in the form of a have payment a reserve requirement \nor a minimum term portfolio requirement the california power market needs to\nmove to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the\nmarket is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to\nelicit new investment . such a structure can help the\ncredit ( but not eliminate )\nfuture price volatility .\n* avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to\nbe restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable\nto encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term\ncontractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the\nmarket structure - such as the three times the and cap has been shifted since\njuly - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to\ndo its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its\ncourse .\n* allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a\nmore balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply\nshortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to\nemissions restrictions .\n* free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa\npower plants that are operational whole are restricted by contract from\noperating to generate only power .\n* * end * *\nthis cera alert will be available in pdf format within incurred hours .\nthis electronic message and attachments if any contain information\nfrom cambridge energy research associates inc .

- sb 18 xx ( burton ) sb 78 xx ( polanco ) ab 82 xx ( keeley ) and ab\n83 xx ( wright ) - - are still in play legislatively this evening even though\nthe governor told the dow jones newswire electric today that the proposals\nare not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly\nand senate to stay in session ( despite the scheduled summer break ) until a\nbill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to\nhim for signature :\n* sb 78 xx ( polanco ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001\npassed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes . the\noriginally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original\nmemorandum of understanding ( mou ) negotiated between governor davis and\nsouthern california edison ( edison ) . it was recently amended to reflect\nsenator sher s proposed plan b of the mou - - a version of certain mou opposed\nby edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy .\nit was heard in the senate energy utilities and communications committee on\nwednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote . reconsideration was\ngranted however and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2\nnoes on thursday morning . the authors took up amendments such as striking\nthe urgency clause changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws \nplacing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399 . 26\n( which insulated edison international from certain claims ) during the\nthursday hearing . sb 78 xx mail then passed out of the senate appropriations\ncommittee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes .\n* sb 18 xx ( burton ) department of water resources : electricity : bond\nfinancing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes to 2\nnoes making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower cheaper rate\nthan allotted in ab lx ( keeley ) assuming the assembly concurs and the bill\nis signed by governor davis . the bill also prohibits any additional charges\nsuch as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and\nrequires the sunshine provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts\nentered to by the dwr . we understand that j . p . morgan and lehman brothers\n- - the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering - -\nhave advised the governor s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of\nthe bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons so it is unclear whether\nthis bill will ever be signed . the bill was heard by the senate energy \nutilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10\nayes and 0 noes vote . it next must be heard in the assembly .\n* ab 82 xx ( keeley ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001\npassed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday\nevening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote . it was then heard later the same\nevening by the assembly appropriations committee where it was passed on a\n11 ayes and 6 noes vote . this is the compromise bill we have been\ndiscussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred\nkeeley . the bill continues and be a work in progress as we write this\nreport with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by\nthe full assembly possibly later this evening . the current powersrc of the\nbill provides for limited direct access state purchase of edison s\ntransmission lines for $ 2 . 4 billion a minimum 30 percent haircut for the\nmajor generators and a trust to cover all claims not dealt with by the\nhaircut option .\n* ab 83 xx ( wright ) alternative earlier utility rate stabilization act\nof 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx ( by assembly member bill campbell ) in the\nassembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening and then\npassed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes . it next must be heard by\nthe assembly appropriations committee barring a rule waiver . no such\ncommittee hearing is scheduled at this time . co - authored by assembly\nmembers rod wright keith richman joe canciamilla and bill campbell the\nbill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address\nthe net xx among other things .\nother energy - related developments they week include :\n* sb 84 xx ( burton ) state energy resources conservation and development\ncommission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and\nsent to the assembly . this bill provides $ 10 million from the state general\nfund to the california energy commission ( cec ) to fund a matching grant\nprogram for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals . the grant\nprogram will be administered by the cec in consultation with local\ngovernments and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup\nsystem . it next must be heard in the assembly .\n* the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board\nfor an independent slate of directors on wednesday the ferc announced on\nfriday . despite a dec 15 2000 ferc order requiring the appointment of an\nindependent governing board for the iso the state has refused to follow the\norder citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of\nthe board . supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees\nshould not oversee power markets due to the state s domineering role in\npurchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities .\n* sb 85 xx ( burton ) electrical restructuring : rates passed out of the\nfull senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes . this bill bars the\ncalifornia public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the\npre - 10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate\nreduction period has expired on march 31 2002 . it next must be heard in\nthe assembly .\n* the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to\ninvestigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company\nexecutives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies \ntrading practices . the resolution - - sr 14 - - passed out with 28 ayes and 6\nnoes .\n* the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted\nunanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas - based reliant\nenergy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents .\ndespite reliant s having handed over 10 000 documents the committee\nrejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality\nof reliant s documents . the committee stepped back from its contempt vote\nlast week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to\nagreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas .\nmirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over\nsubpoenaed documents . the contempt citation against reliant will be\npresented to the full senate and then mail sent to the rules\ncommittee for another hearing before the full senate acts dunn said .\n* the state s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped\nfrom $ 8 . 9 billion to $ 6 . 1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment\nin the state s figure on wednesday . although the state continues to argue\nthat the $ 8 . 9 billion figure is correct ferc judge curtis wagner called the\nfigure baseless and criticized the california delegation for not\nnegotiating in good faith during the recent settlement discussions . the\nnew amount $ 6 . 1 billion does not include power sales to municipal\nutilities and alternative energy suppliers - - two entities that do not fall\nunder the purview of the iso px or the state dwr - - as well as applies ferc\nprice controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales\nfrom october 2 onward .\n* ab 28 xx ( migden ) electrical restructuring : oversight board : iso\npassed out of the senate energy newell and communications committee on\ntuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes . it was amended by\nthe author in committee to double - join it to sb 39 xx ( see below ) . this\namendment ties the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx unless\nthe double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the\ngovernor for signature assuming the bill gets to the governor .\n* sb 39 xx ( speier ) public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly\nenergy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes .\nreconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to\nthe author . given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee ab 28 undercollection is\neffectively dead as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28 xx above . )\nbest regards \ntom mcmorrow and mike martinez\n>\n- iepa legislative report ( 4 ) . do\n",

        "Body": "aluminum smelters ( dsi s )\nalcoa aluminum\nthere are no new developments in the alcoa - bc hydro talks to provide the aluminum producer a source of cheap stable energy . alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller since the load reduction agreement with bpa is still in effect .\nit should be noted that bc s premier gordon campbell has had long - standing poor relations with alcan inc . of canada a competitor of alcoa s . while in the opposition campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $ 1 . 3 b hydroelectric power project . earlier this year bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy - back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border . if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with he will likely do so - to that end look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it .\nalcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements . in a recent shareholder meeting last week alcoa s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re - establishing revenue growth .\nkaiser aluminum\nwith the hiring of harvey perry as the company s new aluminum chief kaiser s long - term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear . as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa they are still in discussions . if anything new that we will keep you updated .\nbc hydro\nbc government\ncampbell s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration . some of the communities in northern british columbia such as fort . st . john dawson creek black gold and fort mcmurray have had significant recent population booms which they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region . currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline arises will run from anwr through british columbia . significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska .\nbc hydro\nhydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers . due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the jobs for power program and pursuing lucrative cross - border contracts with us firms . at the same time hydro will be moving to slice community programs ( anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 million ) and outsourcing from information technology departments for savings in the $ 20 - $ 25 million range . bc hydro whose annual revenues hover typically around $ 300 million is looking at early mini - budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $ 375 million range . its trading subsidiary powerex has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california and it looks like ca will engineers to take this issue to court .\nbc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board and is looking more and more likely to be larry bell from campbell s transition team . we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate although we believe he is a vice - president at west coast energy . the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november . in the meantime campbell and gary collins ( the finance minister ) will be calling the shots on hydro s future . keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines neufeld has the official title but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda .\nbonneville power administration\nfinancial solvency\nafter having a chance to speak with a source close to sen . patty murray s ( d - wa ) office for has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional $ 2 billion in borrowing authority ( over the $ 3 . 75 billion of existing authority it already has ) may be scuttled . sen . murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house the senate appropriations committee omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill . the feeling is that if the $ 2 billion of additional authority would be issued the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare .\neight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half . the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september when there is another energy bill conference . obviously now that bush s energy bill has passed the house they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling .\nspill issues\nthe $ 5 million spill over where columbia river dams a few short weeks after bpa administrator steve wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups .\nfish managers notably critfc s bob heinith and odfw s christine mallette had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year . power operators and the corps of have questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams and hence suffer higher mortality its predators like the bill pike - minnow .\ndam breaching\ncongressman jim mcdermott ( d - wa ) recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way it breaching the four lower snake dams . it would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the corps of politically to partially remove the dams if the secretary of commerce finds it necessary to satisfy esa clean water nowhere or tribal treaty obligations .\n the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal mcdermott said in a july 19 press release . if this northern nudges them to take the plan seriously and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams then no one would be happier than i would he said . now is the time to plan for all contingencies . \nco - sponsored by tom petri ( r - wi ) and 19 other representatives - - but no others from the northwest - - the bill will have difficulty getting out of committee two opposition has massed quickly led by butch otter ( r - id ) and doc hastings ( r - wa ) . the two issued dear colleague letters asking fellow members not to support mcdermott s bill .\npacific northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching . the environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them act to run engineers . now that energy prices have come down again they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation - although they are much weakened now .\nforestry issues\nforest fires\none of the largest forest fires in the pacific northwest the thirty mile fire which claimed the lives of four firefighters is under control this week . the only other major fire in this region currently is the 4 800 - acre union valley fire in southeast washington state . the fire is three and a half miles north of chelan wa and evacuations of residences continue in upper union valley and in washington creek drainage . the fire continues to spread north into washington creek drainage . burnout operations on the northeast flank of the fire were successfully completed . we have not seen any reports of this fire disrupting any electrical lines or significantly hampering transmission \n",

sales were brisk and if enough of you reserve a\ncopy i can get the financing to expand the first printing .\nlet s show the world what parrot heads stand for making making this book a big\nsuccess . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer i had many people tell me\nthey wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss\nto understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .\nmaybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends that\njust don t get it . \nhere s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson founder &\npresident of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with\nthis club on the road dawg tour and shared an advance copy with his club :\n when we received jackson s plea for pictures our members were blown away .\nwe hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the parrot head clubs\nfrom around the globe and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this\ncollection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is\nyour key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom cause this book is packed\nwith those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! \nbobrob sandlapper phc\n- -

quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer andrew s . fastow who was replaced wednesday .\nthe draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency fitch put enron on review for a possible downgrade while another standard it takes time to sell assets particularly in today s slower economy .\nthe company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings a computerized search of the sec s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco .\nchewco was established in 1997 with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments to buy an interest in enron assets according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn t further specify what assets were purchased and it didn t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper a managing director in enron s global equity markets group according to the document .\nenron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed didn t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco .\nmr . kopper who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships didn t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco an enron spokesman would say only that michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july .\nthis statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 000 and involves any director or executive officer . by contrast mr . fastow as cfo would have fallen into that category but mr . kopper as managing director of a business unit presumably wouldn t have .\nhowever reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 a related - party transaction involves a material piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors top officers vice presidents in charge of major business units and other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management . \ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\ndeals & deal makers : enron officials sell shares amid stock -

- enron corp . s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse .\nnot for long some bond traders say .\nin trading yesterday the houston company s five - year bond a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar down from a bid of 88 late wednesday and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks .\nthat is far less than the 50 % decline in enron s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower .\nenron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday s 82 bid for instance was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds a small percentage of a typical trade .\nfueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a securities and exchange of investigation and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer .\n even at these levels there s very little buying interest said time rivkin a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton n . j .\nin one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a default swap - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company s troubles earlier during the year .\neven with its woes enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level .\nyet fitch said yesterday it put enron s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade following a similar move by moody s investors service last week . ( standard & poor s a division of mcgraw hill cos . stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the company s financial flexibility . )\nmeanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels said glenn reynolds an analyst at credit sights inc . an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . they aren t distressed yet but they are headed in that direction . \nif enron s credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the company s ability to raise money . for an energy trader a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments .\nenron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation s energy and gas markets .\nenron s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating the cheaper it can hedge or offset its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating the cost of this high - margin high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to or derived from that of an underlying security or asset such as a stock bond or commodity .\n even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron s counterparties - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - is going to be examining their exposure to enron and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it mr . reynolds said .\nto be sure enron despite its recent woes remains a strong company credit analysts said . i don t think anyone s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default mr . reynolds said .\n so far our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them said ron barone managing director of standard & poor s utility energy project finance group . no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it s business as usual . \nyet analysts say the arrival of distressed -

- critics would say blindly - - enthusiastic about enron even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits . now enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions which many on wall street still can t figure out .\nin a research note wednesday goldman sachs analyst david fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company . the company s lack of disclosure and transparency he says is a longstanding enron hallmark . \nso is this a stock to avoid in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its u . s . select list which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm s larger but prestigious recommended list of 200 or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 .\n just because i can t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can t analyze it or ` i can t figure it out says mr . fleischer who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . if that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn t follow . \nenron s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .\n every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box says jim chanos principal of kynikos associates in new york who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . it was really a trust - me story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . \ntrue no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had .\nbut enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ?\nconcerns about the way that enron runs its business aren t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet and and again wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company s various partnership transactions .\nbesides those partnerships enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings .\nthrough it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling publicly dismissing questions about the firm s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday of the 17 analysts who following the stock 10 had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to thomson financial first call . five others rated the stock a buy though not strongly .\nonly prudential securities which downgraded the stock this week has a sell rating on enron .\nthe bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted .\nover the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index s general collapse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who like goldman s mr . fleischer own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue .\nenron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston enron retained seven co - managers including donaldson lufkin & jenrette lehman brothers and merrill lynch .\n enron is a big company and i don t think you re going to find a firm that hasn t been involved says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a $ 40 price target . they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . \nhe adds we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that s ludicrous . we re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . \nmr . fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small . but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients are happy to know he has a stake in enron because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is .\nin his research note wednesday mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position as an industry leader .\n there s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they re going to make their money but every quarter they do he says . it s hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver . \ncsfb s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday he wrote that he expects questions about enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . \n i know i m wrong on the stock mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices he isn t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst - case scenario - - under which he envisions enron having to issue as much as $ 2 billion worth of shares diluting current holders - - the stock doesn t have much further to fall .\nclearly messrs . launer and flesicher aren t alone . even in relative terms analysts remain very bullish on this stock says chuck hill director of research at thomson financial first call . the average rating for a stock on wall street is 2 . 2 or slightly shy of a buy rating . enron scores a 1 . 6 . this may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out mr loss hill says .\nin downgrading the stock this week prudential analyst carol coale bumped it to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold . while she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her recent downgrades come too little too late . \nms . coale says enron has been difficult to cover for years . she says the company s disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions . for instance she says three weeks ago she asked enron management if the company was under investigation by the securities and exchange commission . they said no she says .\nin light of the company s acknowledgment this week of an sec inquiry she asked enron about the previous denial . they told me it is an inquiry not an investigation she says . an enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the sec s inquiry only last wednesday .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nenron draws down $ 3 bln in credit to boost investor confidence\n2001 -

- an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against mr . levitt s reform efforts - - mr . pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor .\nfrom now on he promised the commission will make sound decisions in a respectful affirmative way not in a demeaning demanding or demonizing way . he spoke favorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty . there was no mention of mr . levitt s concerns about improper management of earnings .\non the heels of mr . pitt s speech the s . e . c . used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors . the decision itself was reasonable although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years . but the way the s . e . c . trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog . is this amnesty for financial fraud ? jane adams the accounting analyst at credit suisse first boston and a former s . e . c . staff member asked in a report to clients . she was not sure of the answer .\nin an interview yesterday mr . pitt dismissed such worries . no one is going to get away with anything he said . what we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable and can talk to the s . e . c . without feeling we are looking for a big splash . \na major embarrassment for accountants is having the s . e . c . force a client to restate its numbers . mr . pitt time his chief accountant robert herdman are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made . i am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program mr . pitt said in the interview but i am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements . \nmr . pitt talks of companies getting it right the first time which would certainly be nice . but there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting figuring there will be no real penalty like a restatement if they are caught . that would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting .\nin trying to sound comforting to the accountants group -

quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier there are no guarantees . amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth -

based energy giant is familiar with commodity\nmarkets . in addition to energy the business for which it is best known \nenron is the world s largest metals trader . the company also understands\ntransportation . it ships products as diverse as coal steel forest\nproducts and project cargo . now enron is proposing to change the face of\nover - the - road trucking and domestic intermodal services by treating\nthem as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product .\nthe company of enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and\ncarriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and\nother shipping costs . enron will quote a set rate for dock - to - dock\nmoves and guarantee the service promised in the contract .\nenron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for\nfreight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in\ntransportation . as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork\nbellies a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery\nof the service or closing out his position .\nenron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in\nenergy . can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight\ncapacity ? barry par - ker a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . which\nspecializes in freight economics said it could work but that\ntransportation isn t like other markets . the marketplace needs these\nthings but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to\nthem parker said . i applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill\nbattle . \nenron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of\nwebmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and\nlogistics services for carriers shippers and service providers . the\nformer webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight s 24 - hour\ncustomer service and operations center . this summer enron took another\nstep by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major\ntrucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales\ncontract with a major shipper but declined to identify it .\ndan reck vice president of enron freight markets said the company can\noffer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are\nconsiderably different from any others . what enron freight markets is\ntrying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the\nfreight market reck said .\na key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and\nconditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery\ntimes and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price\ncontracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes\nand fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only\nbecause it has deep pockets to make cost market liquid but also by using\nits technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having\ncustomers sign long - term contracts .\n what ends up happening is that the obligations of both have be - comes\nmuch more clean and predictable reck said . so from a carrier s\nperspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece\nof their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are\nalso trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and\nconditions . \nenron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural\ngas and electric - power of and is trying to change the way other\nmarkets such as steel are does . efm sees transportation as\nanother commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or\nspeculation .\n we are kind markets commodity - agnostic reck explained . we don t care what\nthe commodity is we just sell capacity . \nenron s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the\ntrucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte the former\nnational transportation exchange puts buyers and sellers directly\ntogether while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify\nthe most the - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike\nthe online services enron contracts directly with the party involved\nand structured not wait for two to be matched up on its website .\nunder enron s ideal contract damages for non - performance are spelled\nout explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers\nmust be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example \nsuppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a\nshipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not\nprovide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the\ncarrier can find is 70 cents per mile enron enron the difference . the\nsame process be work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a\ntruck and didn t enron would provide a replacement at a higher price\nand the trucker would have to make up the difference .\nreck said the standardized contract would not would dictated by enron but\nwould evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under\nway to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other\nintermediaries . enron officials say they ve talked with 400 to 500\nshippers since march .\none goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking\nassociation or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a\nforum for negotiations which the company believes would add legitimacy .\nin its first contract pays is acting as a carrier since the shipper\nalready was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron\nconsiders itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves\nand leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow\nparties to minimize risk for example by giving shippers the ability to\nhedge against the possibility s diesel pass - through fees .\nenron is an extensive user of the internet however and last year\nlaunched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas oil electricity\nand various other commodities online .\nno one expects enron s new freight capacity product to capture immediate\nacceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck\nsaid it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the\nfreight industry and that enron is prepared for that . or have done\nthat in . market we parties gotten into reck said . what we find is\nthe economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance\nover time . you have to show what the benefits are . \njocoo 000 .\n( c ) copyright 2001 the journal of commerce inc every all rights reserved .\nhttp : www . joc . com .\nfolder name : rahil jafry\nrelevance score on scale of 100 : 79\nto review or revise your folder visit http : www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e -

        "Body": "below is the weekly western issues update sent to tim earlier . if you have any questions please feel free to kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) .\nexecutive summary\nferc multi - party refund negotiations\nbpa financials & smelter agreements\nbc hydro rate freeze\npower refunds\nthe big event that happened last week in washington dc in regards to california and the rest of the western energy markets was that multi - party negotiations that flopped - apparently the difference between $ 8 . 9 billion and $ 703 . 6 million between parties could not be settled . below is a rough breakdown corporate offerings :\nwilliams duke reliant dynegy & mirant : $ 510 million combined\npowerex ( bc hydro ) : $ 125 million\n15 power marketers pressure enron : $ 49 . 6 million\n7 california municipal utilities : $ 6 . 5 million\nload - serving entities outside ca : $ 12 . 5 million\nnorthwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges however judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims of $ 611 million in overcharges stating there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties . they did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them . contrary to the 71 s claim a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts . wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast - track status as california . ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressure - the result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together . below is another rough breakdown of the claims :\npacificcorp : $ 6 . 7 million\nsnohomish pud : $ 229 million\ntacoma power : $ judge . 9 million\nseattle city light : $ 222 million\nport of seattle : $ 11 . 1 million\nbpa : $ 70 million *\nbpa\nbpa borrowing : sen . patty murray ( d - wa ) has been leading the fight for bpa s request of $ 2 b in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the senate voted to increase preliminary to additional funds however sen . murray has to to fight the re - authorization caveat . murray s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual re - authorization . bonneville has warned it could exhaust its to authority by the end of 2003 unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of $ 3 . 75 billion - - the increase got through the senate energy & water development subcommittee but had the caveat added when it reached potentially full appropriations committee . increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs . we can expect to see more action coming out of sen . murray s office .\nrefunds : recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities ( including bpa ) seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting . this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings . if a bankruptcy court by to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg & e ( & the bankrupt socal . ed . ) it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of $ 70 m to $ 100 m . however while bpa s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the $ 167 million in gross sales they made from california\nbpa administration : the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa s administrator . the entire northwest delegation ( democrats and republicans from the bpa region ) has asked that he be made the full - time administrator . however since many of the decision - makers at doe are conservative republicans they re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat . at this time doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo .\ndsi aluminum smelter - load hot agreements : bpa is in the reduction seat right now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources . few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year . consequently dsi s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward including on prices ( which are still historically very high but dropping ) . currently there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations . alcoa is in access talks with bc hydro promised secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter and kaiser free from the money and the constraints of a load - reduction agreement is also attempting to restart plants . we will continuing monitoring of this situation core will update as the story develops .\nbc hydro\nrate freeze : the current rate freeze was imposed by the former ndp government and it ends 30 september 2001 . it is up to the government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze and before it can do that it has borrowing schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the bcuc s purview . it has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing and people are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions about overall energy policy . a rate hearing will be delayed until the new government has completed its administrative and review and decided on a broader energy policy including its goals for bc hydro . lifting the rate freeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the rate stabilization account - this money has been redirected elsewhere over the past few years leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of low - water conditions that have surfaced this year . bc hydro wants the freeze lifted and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing the rate freeze given that it was put in place were the ndp and flouts free enterprise principles . this suggests the rate freeze is on the way out but it may persist beyond the original 30 september deadline for the reasons outlined above . how long it persists depends on how long it takes the new government to complete the core review \n",

tom s words of caution :\nif someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the\nability for you to invalidate the deal - and\nthen change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :\n warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure\npipeline allows this change . \nsome pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is\nfeedback - i assume for the same reasons\nwe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just\nin case it causes problems with their\npipeline . sorry - i don t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask\nthe unify team .\nthere is one rule still in place hou you can change from ena - im east to ena - im\nmarket east - but not from\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\nthe same legal entity .\n warning - not the same legal entity \nalso - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals\n( transport capacity storage cash out ) .\nonce the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don t forget - the items\nwere locked down for a reason .\nif you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down\ndata that was validated - and someone used these\ndeals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created\nusing these deals will get corrupted . always check\nwith someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in\nunify .\n- -

        "Body": "executive summary\n? several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the edison mou .\n? a snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that to the outcome .\nprocedural scenarios\nassembly\nthe assembly appropriations committee s plan to take up sb 78 xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote . while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday s draft bill it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend . if the problematic shaver lake provisions are removed from the bill assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill ( although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition ) . if the shaver lake amendments remain several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee .\nassembly speaker bob hertzberg members this edison deal and the business community supports some recent amendments . this likely mitigates concerns from other pro - business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close a personal plea from him and or the governor should enable him affect get to 41 .\nsenate\nthe bill would next move to . senate for approval of the assembly s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb the xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position .\nthis would lead to one of four scenarios :\n? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th \n? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) \n? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support \n? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill - that sending it back to the assembly for more amendments and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate .\njohn burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue thereby burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given burton s past actions he may string them along holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything .\ngovernor\nassuming the bill escapes the senate ( and and deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of edison s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it .\nconsumer groups have vowed to undo any edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all .\ninitiative\nonce drafted and submitted to the attorney general it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days the attorney general sends it to the proponents the senate the assembly and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made .\nthe proponents are change a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before proposal statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on march 5 2002 ( statewide primaries ) and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 2002 . however the window is tight for that election as well and a the would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 .\nthe legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419 260 signatures ) . the ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers . it seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of perception quickly but harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights has been successful at placing pro - consumer initiatives on the ballot before including prop . 9 in 1998 which sought to undo ab 1890 before the public understood its ramifications .\nreferendum\nreferenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives although a successful referendum was on the march 7 2000 ballot the prior to that the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the june 1982 primary election ballot . all four were defeated . since 1912 there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot . of the 50 attempts 39 qualified for the ballot 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect . the circulation calendar verification timing and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives . for example the california constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of 78 enactment of the bill that is being referred . the signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute though .\npolitical dynamics\nnotwithstanding the governor s and assembly speaker s desire to enact an edison rescue package senate president pro tem john burton is in the driver s seat . in fact as noted above there is a money among some that it is the governor who needs burton and not the other way around . one business source close to the negotiations believes burton is not inclined to ask his supports to make a second vote for an edison bailout . in fact members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility their reluctance fed by generators lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess more oppose any bailout .\ncurrently due largely to this dynamic and others such as the shaver lake issue there are not 41 votes for an edison rescue in the assembly . we believe this will allowed as the governor and the speaker exert their influence and the bill will pass the assembly . as difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the assembly the state senate presents an even larger challenge . however at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an edison rescue package being approved by the state senate are less than 50 percent \n",

reem fahey edison mission ; carol guthrie chevron texaco ; shmuel oren university of california - berkley and advises texas puc is andy ott pjm ; michael schnitzer northbridge group .\ngeneral observations\nthe commissioners were again all present ( wood left mid - morning to give testimony on capitol hill ) . today however ferc staff was much more active in ; discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions . the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again . this will probably continue for the rest of the week . what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp . very few panelists have opposed this ; at most a couple coexist panelists have argued that could real time market should not be standardized - - basically conceding that pjm s system will or implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else .\nlocational marginal pricing\nthe panelists all agreed tradable lmp in the real time market is necessary ( schmuel oren does not oppose it ) . most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos . andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real ftrs market is not standardized . carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect . she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works .\nftrs versus flowgates\nthe panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not physical . schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear . most of the panelists including the psc commissioner prefer ftrs rather week flowgates . schmuel is a flowgate advocate . after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood . andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs ( liquidity standard product ) and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point - to - point rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist . if a flowgate ; a hub for transmission rights it s okay . however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling the two cannot of . - seemed to agree with this premise although this is not his preference . he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs . brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs .\nthe panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not agreed upon .\nferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates . many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstances change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant . schmuel said you the use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable .\nthe panelists agreed that these financial rights ( either ftrs be flowgates ) should be tradable in the secondary market . the panelists disagreed on which instrument - - ftrs or flowgates - - are more that . andy thinks ftrs are more tradable ; schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable .\noptions versus obligations\nthe panelists discussed the benefits of having time be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow . andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated . schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front .\nthe afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion . steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly .\nlet me know if you have any questions .\nsara\n",

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date january 1999 .\namong es power 3 s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay listed as a director and mcmahon and fastow listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn t commenting on matters concerning enron common a call to the hang lung group wasn t immediately returned .\ndemands demands\nrating agencies moody s fitch and s & p recently put enron s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade or junk bonds suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .\nif enron s rating drops below investment grade it must find cash or issue stock to pay off the least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .\nfriday the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron s condition .\nthis week a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however in a friday press release ceo lay said that enron was the market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . he added : it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . \nmcmahon reportedly objected to fastow s role in ljm allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he s connected to don t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .\nunder the radar : enron s flickering bulb\nby christopher edmonds\nspecial to thestreet . com\n10 26 2001 05 : 08 pm edt\nurl :\nwhile the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out it s clearly flickering . to date investors aren t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .\nwhat s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ve been imagined with any number of ne er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said i never had to worry about enron s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . \npeter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron s adventures for some time . if you d listened to him earlier other year you d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .\nthe rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are for now just that . and enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis nor is royal dutch shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess his departure appears only indirectly related to enron s current woes .\nnow enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and more importantly its reputation .\nthe company s challenge\nbut what does enron do now ? it s very simple . come clean clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .\n our gut feel is that enron can pull it off and long - term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months says jeff dietert power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . \ndietert outlines four challenges for enron . one management must regain the street s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .\nstraightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .\nalthough enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren t so sure . they re focused on the company s global assets portfolio sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .\nthe divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however enron has to execute here and given the current state of its affairs the seller will feel the pressure .\nthe credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings bbb + from standard & poor s and baal from moody s are three levels above non - investment grade . however both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron limiting enron s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . \nit s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it s a tough call that requires strict individual discipline .\nthere s an irony to this whole story especially in enron s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign enron looking to challenge conventional wisdom asks the simple question why ? ask why . \ninvestors are now asking . it s time for ken lay to answer .\nfirst things first\nmany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .\nthe choice was easy . i m with him and my family .\nenjoy your weekend with family and friends .\ndj enron unit new england market downplay report of default\n2001 -

- ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 2001 - - seattle s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans .\nthe investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that under the law interpreting erisa enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans participants it may be alleged that third and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events .\non oct . 16 2001 enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron s cfo and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .\nif you are a member of an enron retirement plan wish to discuss this announcement or have information relevant to the investigation you may contact paralegal liza catabay or any member of our team ( britt tinglum liza catabay or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 776 -

years of space program efforts .\nvspc has licensed technology that has been has been nurtured tested and proven in labs and space by nasa jpl caltech and university of southern california ( usc ) .\naddress : 2400 lincoln avenue altadena california 91001\ntelephone : ( 626 ) 296 -

9558 e - mail : press to email\nsummary\nwith proprietary technology vspc is driving the growth of very large billion dollar new markets and is expected to generate very significant recurring income with patented technology products .\nto gain competitive advantage strategic partners are willing to integrate vspc s products on a worldwide basis .\nfuture vspc cost - effective growth is based on the fabless business model perfected by the semiconductor industry which for example outsources wafer manufacturing to the far east .\nstrong management team\na strong management team is the most important critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value . vspc has a strong management team ( see below ) .\nlarge rapidly growing markets\nin general to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets and should a to be a significant player in targeted markets . vspc expects to dominate billion dollar markets that do not exist today by introducing believe it or not technology innovations that create and expand markets .\n breakthrough products in the vspc pipeline\nvpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells gps - free navigation especially for places where gps doesn t work ( a top dod priority ) automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) identification of narcotics chemicals and biological weapons .\nanother total breakthrough with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size compared with stationary desk size provided by today s competitors .\nsignificant recurring income from fuel cell batteries\nin five years annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today .\nvspc s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor razor blade model which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade .\nanother analogy is the\nflashlight battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business .\nin this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the flashlight - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the flashlight battery dr - specifically disposable fuel cartridges for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each .\nvspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known major plants in the far east .\nintellectual property protected with patents\nvspc s fuel cell technology for example is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents .\nstrategic partners lend credibility\nto create a cost - effective worldwide footprint emerging companies must partner with branded global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources .\nvspc is partnering with major well - known market leaders who have management resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc s technology and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented proprietary technology obtained from vspc .\nfor example in the fuel cell business performance nec sanyo hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers vspc has opened a tokyo office .\n fabless business model enables cost - effective growth\nfabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies ranked by market capitalization include\n$ 12 billion market cap broadcom ( brcm )\npress here to view\n$ 11 billion market cap marvell semiconductor ( mrvl )\npress here to view\n$ 9 billion market cap xilinx ( xlnx )\npress here to view\n$ 7 . 3 billion market cap altera ( altr )\npress here to view\n$ 4 . 5 billion market cap nvidia corp ( nvda )\npress here to view\n$ 4 . 4 billion market cap sandisk corp ( sndk )\npress here to view\n$ 3 billion market cap ati technologies ( atyt )\npress here to view\n( other technologies products to be discussed in future analyst report updates )\nvspc expects to use emerging computational rf imaging and nanosensor technologies to drive market growth by enabling gps -
